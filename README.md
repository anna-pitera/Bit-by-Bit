### About the Project
Bit by Bit is a gamified to-do list and habit tracker website that encourages users to complete their daily tasks and maintain good habits by rewarding them with in-game currency, which can be used to purchase customization options and in-game benefits.

The project began as part of a semester-long senior year CS Capstone course at the Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science (MATES). For the course, several biweekly progress reports were written along with a project proposal, a midterm slideshow, and a final report, which can all be found in the progress_reports folder in this repository. Although the course has come to a close, development on this project will still continue over the summer of 2024.

### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science (MATES) for giving me the opportunity to do this project and for offering an amazing CS course track. I would also like to thank my computer science teacher and mentor at MATES, Dr. Mike Bixler, for his continuous support and guidance throughout this project. I also want to give recognition to a few very useful libraries and programming resources I've used throughout development:
* [Pixelated rounded corners in CSS tool made by Luke Bonaccorsi](https://pixelcorners.lukeb.co.uk/?radius=4&multiplier=6&border=1&border_width=4&border_color=#222222)
* [NES.css library](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)
